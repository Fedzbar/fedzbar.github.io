	<h3>Operator theory - Spaces and Operators (Intro)</h3>
	<h5>Spaces</h5>
  <p>
      A norm on a vector space $X$ over $\mathbb{F}$ is a map $|| || : X \mapsto [0, \infty)$ which satisfies three
      properties:

      <br>
      i) It maps to 0 if and only if its argument is 0
      <br>
      ii) $||\lambda x|| = |\lambda|||x||, \forall x \in X, \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{F}$
      <br>
      iii) $||x + y|| \leq ||x|| + ||y||, \forall x,y \in \mathbb{F}$
      <br>


      A normed space is called a Banach space if it is complete. Completeness means that every Cauchy
      sequence in $\mathbb{F}$ converges in $\mathbb{F}$, for example $\mathbb{R}$ is a Banach space; however,
      $\mathbb{Q}$ is not as sequences may converge to irrational numbers.

      <br>
      Let $l^p$, $p \in [1, \infty)$ denote the vector space of sequences $x = (x_k)^{\infty}_{k=1}$, with
      $x_k \in \mathbb{F}$, equipped with norm:

      $$
      ||x||_p := (\sum \limits_{k=1}^\infty |x_k|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}, 1 \leq p \lt \infty
      $$
      $$
      ||x||_\infty := \sup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} |x_k| \lt \infty
      $$

      Checking that the above definition is indeed a norm is a very common exercise. $l^p$ is a Banach space.
      Notice that although our sequence definition utilizes an infinite sequence, we can still apply these definitions
      to machine learning as they work for finite dimensional vectors as well (one can imagine finite dimensional vectors
      as infinite dimensional sequences by considering each element and then following them by an infinite amount of zeros).

      <br>

      Two normed spaces $(X, D_X)$ and $(Y, D_Y)$ are called isomorphic if there exists a linear isometry f from X onto Y. An isometry is defined
      to be $D_Y(f(a), f(b)) = D_X(a, b), \forall a,b \in X$.
      We are now ready to introduce operators.
  </p>
  <h5>Operators</h5>
  <p>
    Let X and Y be vector spaces, a map $B:X\mapsto Y$ is called a linear operator if:

    $$B(\lambda x + \psi y) = \lambda B x + \psi B y,\text{ } \forall x, y \in X, \text{ }\forall \lambda, \psi \in \mathbb{F}$$

    For example differentiation is a linear operator (why?), but squaring $()^2$ is not (why?).

    A linear operator B is called bounded if it satisfies the following conditions:

    <br>
    i) B is continuous
    <br>
    ii) B is continuous at 0
    <br>
    iii) $\exists C \lt \infty, st. ||Bx|| \lt C||x||, \forall x \in X$
    <br>
    It can be shown without too much hassle that the three statements are equivalent. We define the norm of a bounded linear operator
    by:

    $$
      ||B|| := \inf \{C: ||Bx|| \leq C||x||, \forall x \in X\}
    $$

    So we get:

    $$||Bx|| \leq ||B||||x||, \forall x \in X$$

    The above statement comes from the definition of norm of the bounded linear operator.

    <br>
    It is also possible to prove that $||.||$ is indeed
    a norm on the space of $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$ (space of all bounded linear operators from X into Y). We also get that
    $||AB|| \leq ||A||||B|||, \forall B \in \mathcal{B}(X, Y), \forall A \in \mathcal{B}(Y, Z)$ and that if Y is complete then
    $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$ is a Banach space.

    <br>
    From these three facts, we can notice that $\mathcal{B}(X) := \mathcal{B}(X, X)$ is a Banach algebra, a normed and complete algebra.

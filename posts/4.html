	<h3>Manifolds - An Introduction</h3>
  <h5>Motivation</h5>
  <p>
    These notes are inspired from the brilliant work done by Loring W. Tu called "An Introduction to Manifolds".

    Manifolds serve as a generalization of curves and surfaces which we are well used to from calculus. Every point in the topology has an open neighbourhood which is homemorphic to 
    $\mathbb{R}^n$ and for this very reason manifolds are locally Euclidean. This local Euclidean property means that we can use concepts from $\mathbb{R}^n$ on these surfaces which turns out to make life
    a lot easier! 
  </p>

  <h5>Topological Manifolds</h5>
  <p>
    Definition: 
    We call a topological space $M$ locally Euclidean of dimension $n$ if every point $p$ in $M$ has an open neighbourhood $U$ such that there is a homemorphism $\phi$ from $U$ to an open
    subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This specific mapping $\phi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is called the coordinate map. The pair $(U, \phi)$ is what we call a chart. 
  </p> 
  <p>
      Definition: 
      A topological manifold of dimension $n$ or an n-manifold is a Hausdorff, second countable locally Euclidean space.
  </p> 
  <p>A very famous example of a 2-manifold is something which everyone is very familiar with: Earth! A chart is actually a very useful name, even though Earth is clearly a 3-dimensional object,
    we can imagine it locally as being a 2-dimensional manifold. We can construct "charts" to represent our planet the same way we construct charts to represent manifolds. The coordinate map is simply
    the definition of HOW we are constructing the charts from the manifold. Notice that there are an infinite amount of ways to chart the surface of the Earth, just like there are an infinite amount of 
    coordinate maps. Conveniently, in topology a group of charts which covers the entire surface is called an Atlas, just like in real life!
  </p>

  <p>Since we just talked about how coordinate maps are not unique, we would like to find a way to transition between two maps. 
    Let $(U, \phi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n)$ and $(V, \psi: V \to \mathbb{R}^n)$ be two charts on a manifold. We call the two maps $C^\infty$ compatible iff 
    $\phi \circ \psi^{-1} : \psi(U \cap V) \to \phi(U \cap V)$ and $\psi \circ \phi^{-1} : \phi(U \cap V) \to \psi(U \cap V)$ are $C^\infty$.
  </p>

  <p>A $C^\infty$ atlas on a manifold M is a cover of M of pairwise $C^\infty$-compatible charts! Try to think about these concepts as they are very important, use the physical meaning of these words
    as aid.
  </p>

  <h5>Smooth Manifolds</h5>
  <p>In mathematics, smooth usually refers to the fact that an object is infinitely differentiable or $C^\infty$. Luckily, with manifolds, the differentiable structure resides in the charts. 
    A Maximal Atlas is an Atlas such that it is not contained in another Atlas. A smooth manifold is a $C^\infty$ manifold with a maximal atlas which is also called a differentiable structure.   
  </p>

  <h5>Smooth Maps on Manifolds</h5>
  <p>
    Intuitively, smooth maps on manifolds work exactly as expected. They are simply maps which are smooth for every point p in the manifold M. Similarly, we can construct smooth maps between 
    two manifolds.
  </p>

  <h5>Diffeomorphisms</h5>
  <p>A diffeomorphism is an isomorphism on smooth manifolds. More formally, if we have two manifolds with differentiable structure $N$ and $M$, a diffeomorphism $F$ is an invertible mapping such that 
    $F: N \to M$ and $F^{-1}: M \to N$ are smooth.
  </p>

  <h5>Partial Derivatives</h5>
  <p>
    Let $f$ be a $C^\infty$ function acting on an n-manifold and $(U, \phi)$ be a chart. First notice that as $\phi$ maps to $\mathbb{R}^n$, it must have $n$ components. 
    Let $x_1,...x_n$ be the components of $\phi$, we notice that with respect to the basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $r_1,...r_n$, then $x_i = r_i \circ \phi$. Now we can construct our partial derivate on the differentiable 
    structure given by the maximal smooth Atlas at a point p in $U$: 
    
    $$
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (p) := \frac{\partial (f \circ \phi^{-1})}{\partial r_i}(\phi (p)) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}
      \phi^{-1} \circ \phi (p)
    $$

    Another interesting property is the following: 

    $$
      \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial x_j} (p) = \frac{\partial (x_i \circ \phi^{-1})}{\partial r_j} \phi(p) = \frac{\partial r_i}{\partial r_j} \phi(p)
    $$
  </p>

  <h5>Invertibility </h5>
  <p>As discussed previously, manifolds are locally $\mathbb{R}^n$ which means that a lot of properties from real analysis can be transferred over. Namely one of these is the inverse
    function theorem which states that a function $F$ which maps from a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally invertible iff the Jacobian determinant $det[\partial F_i / \partial r_j (p)]$ is 
    not zero. Now since manifolds are locally a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, this theorem holds for manifolds too!

	<h3>Operator theory - Spectral Theory Introduction</h3>
  <h5>Preliminary Results</h5>
  Let's start with some definitions. Let $A$ be an operator from a vector space $X$ into 
  a vector space $Y$. We define the kernel of A to be: 

  $$  
    \text{Ker}(A) := \{x \in X: Ax = 0 \}
  $$

  and the range of A: 

  $$
    \text{Ran}(A) := \{Ax : x \in X\}
  $$

  It is clear that the kernel is a linear subspace of X, while the range is a linear subspace of Y. 
  We are ready to introduce an important theorem.

  <br> 

  Theorem: Let X and Y be Banach spaces and $B \in \mathcal{B}(X, Y)$ with $\text{Ker}(B) = {0}$ and 
  $\text{Ran(B)} = Y$, then the inverse operator $B^{-1} : Y \mapsto X \in  \mathcal{B}(Y, X)$ (is bounded).
  What this theorem says is that a bijective bounded linear operator has a bounded inverse.

  Before defining the spectrum, we also have to prove some results for inverse bounded operators.

  <br> 

  By $I$ we denote the Identity operator ($Ix = x \forall x \in X$).

  <br> 
  Let X be a Banach space, $B \in \mathcal{B}(X)$ and $||B|| < 1$, then $I-B$ is invertible,
  
  $$(I-B)^{-1} = \sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} B^n$$ 
  and 
  $||(I-B)^{-1}|| \leq \frac{1}{1 - ||B||}$.
  <br> 
  Proof:
  It follows that from the fact that for two operators A and B then $||AB|| \leq ||A||||B||$ that 
  
  
  $$||B^n|| \leq ||B^{n-1}||||B||| \leq ... \leq ||B||^n$$ 
  
  From the fact that $||B|| < 1$, 
  we get that the series $\sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} ||B||^n$ converges absolutely, and since X is a 
  Banach space, any absolutely convergent series converges so we get that $\sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} B^n$ 
  is also convergent. This is because:

  $$\sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} ||B^n|| \leq \sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} ||B||^n$$

  from the inequality shown above. Now let's prove that the inverse exists, to show that $S = (I - B)^{-1}$ we must show that
  $S(I-B) = (I-B)^{-1}(I-B) = I$: 

  $$
    S(I - B) = \sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} B^n (I - B) = \sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} B^n  - \sum \limits_{n=0}^{\infty} B^{n+1} = I

  $$
  
  (similar argument works for $(I-B)S$) To summarise, we just showed that $(I-B)^{-1}(I-B) = I$ and thus that the series is indeed equal to that inverse operator. The inequality can be easily
  proven with the well known geometric series result. QED.

  <h5>The spectrum</h5>
  Let X be a Banach space and $B \in \mathcal{B}(X)$. The resolvent set $\rho(B)$ of the operator B is 
  the set of all $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $B - \lambda I$ is invertible. The spectrum $\sigma(B)$ is the complement
  of this set: $\sigma(B) = \mathbb{C} \setminus \rho(B)$. We can therefore see that all eigenvalues of B belong to 
  $\sigma(B)$. 
  
  <br>
  Proof:

  Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue for a respective eigenvector $\psi$ ($\psi \neq 0$). Then: 
  $(B - \lambda I)\psi = 0$, but since we also have that $(B - \lambda I)0 = 0$ we notice that the operator 
  $(B - \lambda I)\psi$ is not injective and thus not invertible and thus part of $\sigma(B)$. QED.
  Note that the set of eigenvalues may be smaller than the spectrum of B.

  <br>
  The spectral radius $r(B)$ is defined to be:

  $$r(B) := \sup\{|\lambda|: \lambda \in \sigma(B)\}$$

  Therefore the spectral radius is the minimal ball centered at 0 containing the spectrum. We also get
  that (the proof is quite involved).
  $$
    r(B) = \lim_{n \to \infty} ||B^n||^{\frac{1}{n}}
  $$

  For completeness, I will mention adjoint operators, which for an operator $A \in \mathcal{B}(X, Y)$ is defined
  to be $A^* : Y^* \mapsto X^*$ by: 

  $$(A^*g)(x) := g(Ax), \forall g \in Y^*, \forall x \in X$$

  and a projection which is an idempotent operator ($A = A^2$).

  To conclude, let's introduce compact linear operators. A linear operator $T: X \mapsto Y$ is called compact if it maps
  closed subsets of X to relatively compact sets of Y (relatively compact means that the closure of the set is compact).
